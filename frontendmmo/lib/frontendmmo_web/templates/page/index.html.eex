            There is a 40x40 map made out of 1600 tiles. The border tiles are not accesible. <br><br>
            When a player enters the map, it spawns at tile (39, 39) and has HP of 100. <br>
            A player can move north, east, south or west on the map. It can only move 1 tile at a time. <br>
            A player can attack an adjacant player. The other player has to be in a radius of 1 tile in order for it to be hit. When two players are standing on the same tile, they canâ€™t hit each other. <br>
            When a player  is hit, it loses 10HP. If the player has no HP left after that, it respawns at start with 100HP. <br>
